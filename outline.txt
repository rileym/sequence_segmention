# sequence (e.g., text, path through a document object)
# candidate_boundries: sequence -> candidate_boundry_idx_iter
# context: (sequence, index) -> context
# candidate_boundry_contexts: sequence -> (index, couniterable (iterates over the candidate_boundry_context objects in order), e.g., [\.?!] in text or paragraphs in a docx with index into the original sequence)
# labeled_boundry_iter: (iterates over candidate_boundry_contexts with label mark up, outputs (candidate_boundry_context, label) tuple)
## NOTE: candidate_boundry_object needs to contain enough information to create feature vector (e.g., need to be able to retrieve any context from the sequence)
# feature_extractor: candidate_boundry_contexts -> feature vector 
## NOTE: should ignore labeling mark-up
# segmenter (boundry_clf, sequence, candidate_boundry_iter_fn)


Example: Sentences Boundries
# sequence: text
# candidate_boundryies: index into texts at [\.!?] etc
# labeled_candidate_boundries: (index, label) into candidate_boundries with labeles # should we force all candidate_boundries to be considered labeled negatively if no label in and the sequence is a training document
# context: text -w and +w words surrounding the candidate_boundry
# feature_extractor: tfidf of window before, tfidf of window after, punctuation information, capitalization information, 
# segmentor ()

# seq -> context dataset -> feature dataset for training
